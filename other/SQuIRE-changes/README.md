# README
Minor changes to [SQuIRE](https://github.com/wyang17/SQuIRE) R codes. You can copy them to SQuIRE/squire and you will get plots for all DE genes/TEs. If you already have `.pyc` files you can run `python -m compileall script.py` (of course with squire conda env activated) which will recompile `.pyc` files.
